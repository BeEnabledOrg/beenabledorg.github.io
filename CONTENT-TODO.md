# Content still needed

Everything below is deliberately blank or marked "coming soon" on the live site.
None of it has been filled with plausible-sounding placeholder text, because for
a real 501(c)(3) invented specifics are a liability rather than a placeholder.

Search the repository for `TODO(content)` to find each spot in context.

## Legal and organisational — blocking

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| EIN (tax identification number) | `about/index.html`, footer partial |
| Mailing address | `about/index.html`, `contact/index.html`, footer |
| Year founded | `about/index.html`, JSON-LD `foundingDate` |
| Board and staff names and roles | `about/index.html` |
| Annual report or financials link | `about/index.html` |

## Contact — blocking

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Real contact email (currently `hello@beenabled.org`, unverified) | `contact/index.html`, footer |
| Phone number, and whether relay and video relay calls are accepted | `contact/index.html` |
| Form endpoint for the contact form `action` | `contact/index.html` |

The contact form currently posts to `#`. Until an endpoint is set, the email
link is the working path. Whatever endpoint you choose must accept a plain
`POST` of form fields; do not swap in an embedded third-party widget, because
those reliably fail Level AAA and cannot be fixed from the outside.

## Fundraising — blocking before launch

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Donation URL (Givebutter, Stripe, PayPal…) | `get-involved/index.html` |
| Mailing list signup URL | `get-involved/index.html` |

Both are `href="#"` right now. Keep them as outbound links rather than embedding
the provider's form on the page.

## Programme detail

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Whether EnableMe and other projects should get their own pages | new `projects/` section |

The Blue Envelope Project now has its own page at `/blue-envelope/`, with a
directory of state and local programs. That directory was compiled through
research (state agency pages, legislature and bill-tracking sites, and news
coverage, including research assisted by AI tools) rather than confirmed by
phone with every program — see the callout and "Where this directory comes
from" section on that page. Treat it as a living document: correct it as
programs launch, change, or close. `glossary/index.html`
(`#blue-envelope-project`) now has real copy too.

## Accessibility statement

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Date of the first full manual audit | `accessibility/index.html` |
| Which screen readers and browsers were tested | `accessibility/index.html` |

Do not publish a review date until the manual pass in `ACCESSIBILITY-TESTING.md`
has actually been done.

## Social and search

| What | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Social profile URLs, for JSON-LD `sameAs` | `tools/scaffold-pages.mjs`, the `NGO` block |
| Confirm `beenabled.org` DNS points at GitHub Pages | `CNAME` |
